			<h1>Origin stories</h1>
			<p>
			Kotar and his mate, Lunob, were the first Klingons. Their hearts were forged by the gods themselves in a place called QI'tu'. Their love for one another was so great that they destroyed the gods who created them and burned the heavens. Kotar's punishment for  was to ferry the souls of the dishonored dead to Gre'Thor where they will be tortured by Fek'lhr for all eternity. Their story is recounted and celebrated in every Klingon wedding ceremony. "No one can oppose the beating of two Klingon hearts."

			There is evidence that all humanoid species share a single genetic origin, which may account also for the similarities in many origin myths from across the cultures of inhabited planets.

			<h1>The birth of the Empire</h1>
			<p>
			The origins of the Klingon Empire are shrouded in myth. The central event, however, remains largely undisputed: that Kahless the Unforgettable fought and killed the tyrant Molor. This is the story of a popular uprising against brutal tyrrany. Kahless was a commoner and Molor was of noble birth. Under the old system, Molor was the rightful ruler of Qo'noS, the Klingon homeworld. Kahless' defeat of Molor represents not only the defeat of a single tyrant by a commoner, but also the defeat of tyranny by an oppressed people.
			</p>
			<p>
			After Kahless defeated Molor, the latter's volcanic shrines, where people would be sacrificed to honor the tyrant, were destroyed. Eventually a new nobility was established, tied to those descended of Kahless and the houses of the people who fought with him against Molor's tyranny. To avoid the further entrenchment of nobility and tyrranny on Q'onoS, Kahless left, saying that he was going to Sto-vo-kor while pointing to a star. It is believed that he will one day return.
