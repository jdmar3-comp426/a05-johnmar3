			<h1>Kahless the Unforgettable</h1>
			<p>
			Kahless is the great unifier of the Klingon people. He is the first to have used a bat'leth, which he made from a lock of his own hair forged in a volcano. Kahless was both a great warrior and a tremendous leader, unifying Klingons at war with one another so that they could conquer the stars.

			  Despite his moniker "the unforgettable," we do not actually know what Kahless looked like, because no image recording technologies existed while he lived and no renderings of him dating to the period of his life have survived. This is an artist's rendering.
